* Benchmarks
Following table contains average time in seconds over 100 runs of each challenge (year/day/part). This is generated by ~bench.py~ script.

Benchmarks in this table might initially come from either:
- Macbook Air M1 16GB, the standard for the benchmark.
- Dell laptop that runs windows with WSL2. Specs are irrelevant, as this is not the standard for the table, and will be replaced by M1 version at first occasion, whether they are better or worse.
