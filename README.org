- gen.py [YEAR, DAY] :: creates necessary directories for running and testing challenges, applies templates from template directory
- run.py [YEAR, DAY, PART] :: fetches and executes given part of a challenge
- test.py [YEAR, DAY, PART] :: runs unit tests for given challenge. Can run single or both parts.
- bench.py [YEAR, DAY, PART] :: measures average time over 100 runs in seconds for given challenge

* Rules (for myself)
1. No chatGPT or similar tools
2. No looking up answers
3. Stick to standard library, unless strictly necessary
4. Do my best to write simple and clean code
5. Publish honest benchmarks for each day and part
